# Day 03 — Linux Permissions, Ownership & Process Management

## What I worked on
- Practiced Linux file permissions using chmod
- Explored permission values for owner, group, and others
- Understood file ownership and groups using chown
- Observed running processes using ps and top
- Identified service-related processes (NGINX)
- Managed services using systemctl
- Viewed system and service logs using journalctl

## Key Learnings
- File permissions control who can read, write, or execute files
- Incorrect permissions or ownership can prevent applications from working
- Ownership matters when applications run as non-root users
- ps and top help identify running processes and resource usage
- systemctl is used to manage and troubleshoot services
- Logs are critical for debugging system and service issues

## Environment
- Platform: AWS EC2
- OS: Ubuntu Linux
- Access: SSH (as non-root user)
