# Day 03 — Linux Permissions & Process Management

## What I worked on
- Practiced Linux file permissions using chmod
- Understood read/write/execute for owner, group, and others
- Learned file ownership using chown
- Explored running processes using ps and top
- Managed services using systemctl (NGINX)

## Key Learnings
- Linux permissions play a critical role in security and deployments
- Incorrect ownership can cause applications to fail at runtime
- SSH keys rely on strict file permissions
