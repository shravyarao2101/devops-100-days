# Day 03 — Linux Permissions & Process Management

## What I worked on
- Practiced Linux file permissions using chmod
- Understood read/write/execute for owner, group, others
- Learned file ownership using chown
- Explored running processes using ps and top
- Managed services using systemctl (NGINX)

## Key Learnings
- Permissions are critical for security and deployments
- SSH keys depend on correct file permissions
- Service management is a core DevOps responsibility
- Understanding processes helps debug real production issues
- Incorrect ownership can cause applications to fail at runtime
