# Day 07 — Environment Variables & Config-Driven Scripts

## What I did
- Practiced creating and using environment variables
- Created a configuration example file (.env.example)
- Modified a Bash automation script to be config-driven
- Added fail-fast checks for missing configuration
- Verified correct and incorrect execution behavior

## Key Learnings
- Configuration must be separated from code
- Environment variables enable the same script to run across environments
- Failing fast on missing config prevents silent production issues
- This pattern is foundational for Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes
