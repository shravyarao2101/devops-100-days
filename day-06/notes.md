# Day 06 — Linux Processes & Automation

## What I did
- Inspected NGINX as both a process and a systemd service
- Practiced safe service lifecycle commands (stop/start/reload/restart)
- Built a Bash script to capture NGINX health data
- Generated timestamped logs automatically
- Scheduled and verified execution using cron

## Key Learnings
- Processes show runtime state; services manage lifecycle
- Reload is safer than restart in production environments
- Bash scripting enables repeatable operational checks
- Cron provides lightweight automation without external tools
